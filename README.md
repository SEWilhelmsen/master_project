# Metabolic Dysregulation During Early Stages of Heart Failure

Master thesis project in Clinical Nutrition at University of Oslo. 

*Background* : Heart failure is a common syndrome in the population with few available treatments and high mortality . HF is associated with metabolic dysfunction, hypertrophy, left ventricle (LV) dysfunction and pressure overload, but causal molecular drivers remain unknown as methods to investigate causal relationships have been scarce.
Objectives: O-ring aortic banding (ORAB) in mice allows for the first time to map detailed temporal development of pressure overload and metabolic dysfunction, and the objective of this master’s thesis is to evaluate whether (1) energy metabolic dysfunction is a causal factor in LV dysfunction development in pressure overload, and (2) which transcription factors and signalling pathways contribute to metabolic dysfunction. 

*Methods*: C57BL/6J mice were operated with ORAB or control (SHAM) surgery at nine weeks of age. Phenotyping data were collected at 6 and 12 hours, 1 and 3 days, and 1 and 3 weeks after surgery, and tissue was sequenced by single nucleus RNA and ATAC or spatial transcriptomics. Preprocessing of data and downstream analyses were done in R using Seurat, Signac, Azimuth, org.Hs.eg.db, SingleCellExperiment, clusterProfiler and PROGENy.

*Results*: ORAB mice demonstrated a significant increase in left ventricle to body weight ratio from 12 hours and in fibrosis area at 3 weeks compared to SHAM. Gene ontology analysis showed a significant increase in expression level for uptake and utilisation of fatty acids, glucose and ketones, the latter demonstrating the highest increase in ORAB CMs compared to SHAM at 3 weeks. No spatial expression pattern was found for any of the energy metabolic genes. NFκB and TNFα pathways were activated in SHAM at 6 hours but activated at 12 hours and 3 days after ORAB surgery. 

*Conclusions*: Our temporal data showed that energy metabolism underwent a switch at around 3 days from downregulated to upregulated. Inflammation pathways NFκB and TNFα were activated later and lasted longer after ORAB surgery and were followed by activation of apoptosis pathway p53. Whether these mechanisms are causal drivers of LV dysfunction or compensatory strategies is difficult to determine based on RNA data and more research is needed to fully understand the disease development.

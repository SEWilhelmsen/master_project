# The role and cause of metabolic dysfunction in heart failure after pressure overload 

Master thesis project in Clinical nutrition at University of Oslo. 

*Background*: Heart failure (HF) is a common syndrome in the population with few available treatments and high mortality. HF is associated with cardiac remodeling and left ventricle (LV) dysfunction, but the relative role of metabolic dysfunction versus other disease mechanisms such as fibrosis and cell death, and molecular drivers remains unknown.

*Objectives:* O-ring aortic banding (ORAB) in mice allows for the first time to map detailed temporal development of pressure overload, and the objectives of this masterâ€™s thesis is to evaluate whether (1) metabolic dysfunction is a causal factor in LV dysfunction development in pressure overload, and (2) which transcription factors and signalling pathways contribute to metabolic dysfunction. 

*Methods*: C57BL/6J mice were operated with ORAB or control (SHAM) surgery at nine weeks of age. Phenotyping data were collected at 6 time points after surgery, and tissue was sequenced by single nucleus RNA and ATAC or spatial transcriptomics. Preprocessing of data and downstream analyses were done in R using among others Seurat, Signac, Azimuth, org.Hs.eg.db, SingleCellExperiment, clusterProfiler and PROGENy.

*Results*: After ORAB surgery, mice gradually developed LV hypertrophy from day 1 and fibrosis at 3 weeks. Gene  expression levels for genes involved in uptake and utilisation for fatty acids, glucose and ketone bodies, as well as genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle were downregulated at early time points but upregulated at 3 weeks after ORAB surgery. The activity of signalling pathways showed no clear pattern compared with fibrosis formation and LV hypertrophy after ORAB surgery. 

*Conclusions*: Our temporal data show that energy metabolism expression underwent a switch at around 3 days from downregulated to upregulated and signalling pathway activity revealed no clear specific driver of disease. Whether these mechanisms are causal drivers of LV dysfunction or compensatory strategies is difficult to determine based on RNA data alone and more research is needed to fully understand the causal relationships between these factors.

# Metabolic Dysregulation During Early Stages of Heart Failure

Master thesis project in Clinical Nutrition at University of Oslo. 

*Background*: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a common syndrome in the population with few available treatments and high mortality. HFpEF is associated with metabolic dysfunction in heart muscle cells, but it remains unclear if metabolic dysfunction is a causal driver of disease progression. To identify causal drivers of metabolic dysfunction could contribute in development of better treatments and prevent disease progression early in the early stages. 

*Objectives*: O-ring based aortic constriction (ORAB) in mice allows for the first time to map detailed temporal development of HFpEF and metabolic dysfunction, and the objective of this masterâ€™s thesis is to evaluate whether (1) metabolic dysfunction is a causal factor in HFpEF development, and (2) which transcription factors that contributes to metabolic dysfunction. 

*Methods*: C57bl/6js mice were operated with ORAB or control surgery at 9 weeks of age. Echocardiography and other phenotyping were done at six different time points after surgery, and the left ventricle was either sequenced by single nucleus ATAC/RNA-sequencing or spatial transcriptomic. Phenotyping data is compared to sequencing data for time and region of left ventricle with use of RStudio.
